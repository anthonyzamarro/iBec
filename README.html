<h1 id="ibectestproject2019">iBec Test Project 2019</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to the iBec Creative Test Project. We&#8217;re excited to see your approach to development. This project is meant to help iBec Creative determine your proficiency in HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript. It&#8217;s also meant to see how well you can translate a design into code.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We&#8217;d like you to spend 2 - 3 hours working on this project. We&#8217;ve provided a design that we&#8217;d like you to follow. There are some vague aspects of the design that we&#8217;d like you to figure out, there isn&#8217;t one way to code this and we&#8217;d like to see how <em>you&#8217;ll</em> solve the problem</p>

<p>Additionally, we&#8217;d like this to serve as your job application. The design is a framework for you to put in your own information. In order to be considered for the position your project must include the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A photo (It doesn&#8217;t have to be a photo of you, but a photo you&#8217;ve taken would be nice)</li>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>A brief biography telling us about yourself</li>
<li>Your phone number</li>
<li>Your email address</li>
<li>A link to your current resum√©</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do not use Node.js - We don&#8217;t have anything against Node. We use it, but this project does not require it, like, at all.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve included a SCSS folder, we&#8217;d like you to use it. You can compile it using any number of css preprocessors or install sass directly. If you aren&#8217;t set up for it, or don&#8217;t know it - just use CSS.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve included all the files you need to get started.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ve included the design (Sketch &amp; JPG formats) for you to reference.</li>
<li>We require that some aspect of this project use Javasript, you can determine where and how to use it.</li>
<li>Be creative &amp; have fun!</li>
</ul>
