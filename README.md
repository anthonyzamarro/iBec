# iBec Test Project 2019
Hello, and welcome to the iBec Creative Test Project. We're excited to see your approach to development. This project is meant to help iBec Creative determine your proficiency in HTML, CSS & Javascript. It's also meant to see how well you can translate a design into code.

## Goals
We'd like you to spend 2 - 3 hours working on this project. We've provided a design that we'd like you to follow. There are some vague aspects of the design that we'd like you to figure out, there isn't one way to code this and we'd like to see how _you'll_ solve the problem

Additionally, we'd like this to serve as your job application. The design is a framework for you to put in your own information. In order to be considered for the position your project must include the following information:

* A photo (It doesn't have to be a photo of you, but a photo you've taken would be nice)
* Your name
* A brief biography telling us about yourself
* Your phone number
* Your email address
* A link to your current resum√©

## Rules
* Do not use Node.js - We don't have anything against Node. We use it, but this project does not require it, like, at all.
* We've included a SCSS folder, we'd like you to use it. You can compile it using any number of css preprocessors or install sass directly. If you aren't set up for it, or don't know it - just use CSS.
* We've included all the files you need to get started. 
* We've included the design (Sketch & PNG formats) for you to reference.  
* We require that some aspect of this project use Javasript, you can determine where and how to use it.
* Be creative & have fun!
